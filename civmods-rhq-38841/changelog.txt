RHQ 2.06 Patch Notes
------------------------

New Firaxis patch is so good, I have to remove most things. Leaving settling improvements, and a small set so everyone can play the new version and find new bugs.

We may have to turn manu things back on, but it's such a massive upgrade, I had to undo a ton of things just to start after the patch.

--------------------------
-- RHQ 1.0
--------------------------

Core AI Behavior Changes:
- Settler units now move more aggressively. Non-moving turn limit reduced from 5 to 1, making settlers much quicker to reach their destinations.
- City founding is now a higher priority operation (Priority 4). The AI will be more focused on expansion.
- AI cities get stronger defenses. Cities will maintain larger defensive forces with specific unit composition requirements.

Military Improvements:
- More balanced army compositions for city attacks:
  - Minimum 3 melee units (up from 2)
  - Up to 12 ranged units (up from 3)
  - Settlers explicitly excluded from attack forces
- Similar changes for Independent city attacks:
  - Minimum 3 melee units (up from 1)
  - Up to 12 ranged units (up from 2)
  - Settlers protected from combat duty

City Defense Operations Overhaul - AI will defend more consistently and with better units.
- New minimum requirements for city garrisons:
  - At least 1 melee unit
  - At least 1 ranged unit
  - Up to 2 siege units allowed (previously no maximum limit)
  - Settlers excluded from defensive duties
- Defense trigger threshold lowered. Cities will form defensive armies more readily.

Settlement Logic Updates:
- Natural wonders now properly valued in city placement
- Coastal settlements more carefully evaluated
- Science-focused civs place higher priority on science. 
- Exploration-focused civs more likely to settle near production tiles. 

Explorer Changes:
- Reduced explorer unit spam. AI will build fewer explorers, using them more strategically.
- I tried to sort out targetting, I don't see a way. There seem to be too few artifacts for a win condition.

Strategic Priorities:
- Higher value placed on city upgrades
- Increased emphasis on maintaining standing armies
- New combat odds requirements:
  - 35% minimum odds for attacking cities
  - Same threshold for attacking barbarian outposts
  - More cautious approach to military engagements
  - The AI is more likely to attack weakly defended cities

This update makes the AI more aggressive with expansion while maintaining better defended cities. Military operations are more strategic with proper unit compositions. The core focus is on making the AI better at fundamental game mechanics - expanding, defending, and executing military operations with appropriate forces. This will dramatically improve their performance in all game functions.
