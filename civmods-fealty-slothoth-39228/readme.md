Fealty: Transfer Settlements to Allies

Ever wish you could offload those dinky little settlements to your allies?
Ever decimate a settlements defenses, then hope your ally comes to clear up the mess?
This mod is for you. Adds a button to the Diplomacy screen of your allies allowing you to trade settlements to them
without having to go to war with them. Our settlement caps are satiated, and we can now indulge our little pet AIs.

The system Firaxis enabled for peace deals allows evaluating settlements, so you can even trade cities if the one you offer is good enough.

The placement of the button and its text is a bit WIP.

V1.0: Made mod.

V1.01: Amended to fix issues with patch 1.22
