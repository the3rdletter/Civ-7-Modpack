## Resource Re-sorts 2.2.0
better resource organization

new sorting options for the resource allocation screen:
- sort settlements by **name, yield,** or **total resource slots**
- easily change sort order and direction
- optionally separate cities and towns

each settlement also shows local conditions that affect resource
bonuses, like **Distant Lands** in the Exploration age, or **Port, Rail
Station,** and **Factory** buildings in the Modern age.

## localization
the mod is language-independent during play.
only the menu screens (Mods and Options) contain localized text.

supported languages:

- French (translated by Somchai2548)
- German (translated by Chr1Z93)
- Italian (translated by leonardfactory)
- Korean (translated by Hotsolidinfill)
- Russian (translated by Webrok)
- Simplified Chinese (translated by v480615)
- Traditional Chinese (translated by v480615)
