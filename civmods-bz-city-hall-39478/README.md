# City Hall 2.0.3
better city & town tools for Civilization VII

## improved production list and city details
new and improved features:

- City Overview tab with extra stats and clickable connections
- compact production list and building breakdown
- better city maps and overlays
- unique quarter assistant
- improved controller interface

## better city maps
see your settlements clearly with gentle shading outside city limits and
brighter colors for developed tiles:

- purple for the city center
- blue for urban districts
- teal for offshore improvements
- green for other rural improvements

all overlays show white outlines around the city center and urban core.

## unique quarter assistant
guides unique building construction in the building interface, with
orange hexes to warn you before blocking a unique quarter by:

- placing unique buildings on different tiles
- completing a non-unique quarter with a unique building
- adding a non-unique building to a unique district

the interface now recognizes unique buildings in progress and in the
production queue, to help you plan both buildings at the same time.

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **F1rstDan's Cool UI: no conflicts.** when both mods are installed,
  you can use the Options menu to customize production list styling.
