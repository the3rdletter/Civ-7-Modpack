# City Hall 1.13.0
better city & town tools for Civilization VII

## improved production list and city details
new and improved features:

- color-coded city views with buildings and adjacency bonuses
- unique quarter assistant
- one-click repairs
- compact production list and building breakdown
- production list sorted by total yield, combat strength, and cost
- building breakdown sorted by improvement and wonder names
- a new City Overview tab showing demographics and connected settlements

## better map view
see your settlements clearly with gentle shading outside city limits and
brighter colors for developed tiles:

- purple for the city center
- blue for urban districts
- teal for offshore improvements
- green for other rural improvements

the center stays purple in building placement mode, to help you stay
oriented.  (it turns a darker purple if you can't build in the center.)
the city map shows building icons in the main view, and the buildings
have flags with their adjacency bonus yields.

## unique quarter assistant
guides unique building construction in the building interface, with
orange hexes to warn you before blocking a unique quarter by:

- placing unique buildings on different tiles
- completing a non-unique quarter with a unique building
- adding a non-unique building to a unique district

the interface now recognizes unique buildings in progress and in the
production queue, to help you plan both buildings at the same time.

## one-click repairs
when your city needs repairs, you can buy them with just one click.

- repairs always appear at the top of the production list, highlighted
- you don't need to select a tile unless there's more than one choice

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments: no conflicts.**
- **F1rstDan's Cool UI: no conflicts.** when both mods are installed,
  you can use the Options menu to customize production list styling.
- **MantisMaestro's Compact Production Chooser: mostly compatible.**
  when both mods are installed, MM's production list replaces the City
  Hall version, which also disables some features like one-click
  repairs.
- **Slothoth's Abbreviated Repair: incompatible,** but City Hall
  provides an equivalent feature, one-click repairs.
